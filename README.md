Dabbling in GitHub
Exploring the data science field to see if I should move in this career direction. Have been using data related to new synthetic compounds in the drug discovery field to help prioritize and de-prioritize which structural series are of most potential value. Maybe this data experience will allow addressing other questions that could be illuminated with data insights.
